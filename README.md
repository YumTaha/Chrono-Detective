# Chrono-Detective
In this game, the player takes on the role of a detective who has the 
ability to travel through time. The detective's mission is to solve 
a series of crimes that have been committed throughout history.

To solve the crimes, the player must use their time-traveling abilities 
to visit different eras and gather clues. The game will have different
levels, each set in a different time period, such as Ancient Egypt, 
Medieval Europe, or the Wild West.

As the player collects clues, they will have to use their deduction skills 
to piece together the evidence and solve the crime. The game will also include 
puzzles and mini-games that will help the player uncover hidden information 
and advance through the levels.

To add to the challenge, the player will have to be careful not to alter 
history or create paradoxes that could jeopardize their investigation. 
The game will keep track of the player's actions and decisions, 
and their choices will affect the outcome of the story.
